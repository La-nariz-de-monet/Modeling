# Description of Turing Machine

 **Turing Machine**: Is building with:
  * A **tape** divided into cells where each cells contains a simbol from some finite alphabet. 
  * A **head** that can read and write symbols on the tape and move the tape left and right one (and only one) cell at a time.
  * A **status record** that stores the status of the Turing machine, one of the finite states. There is a special initial state with which the status log starts.
> Our program is in the tape, and our head will move left or right
depending the instructions in the Card Number 1. The Card Number contains the 
instructions for behavior of head.
